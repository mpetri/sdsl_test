This is a set of tests for the succinct data structure library (sdsl).

We expect that the gtest library (consisting of the files
libgtest.la and libgtest_main.la) can be found at
the directory ${HOME}/lib and the header file are in the
directory ${HOME}/lib/gtest .

You can compile the test by calling "make" and
execute them by calling "make test".
